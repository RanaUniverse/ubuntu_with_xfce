# Ubuntu with Xfce

Os Checking: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS

I will just install xfce here so that it will be lightweight and easy to use.

# This repo is made to help me to install the xfce and the needful extensions here.

`sudo apt install thunar-archive-plugin` is there to add extra archieve like extra features in the file manager here in xfce.
